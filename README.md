Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression.

* Situation: With millions of transactions occurring daily, it is crucial to identify and flag suspicious transactions to prevent financial losses. The institution has a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, making it a challenging task to detect fraud transactions.Logistic regression is a statistical algorithm which analyze the relationship between two data factors. Developed a credit card fraud detection model using Logistic Regression to identify fraudulent transactions in a highly unbalanced dataset.

* Task:  Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns or correlations. Built a classification model to predict fraudulent transactions, evaluated model performance, and visualized results.

* Action: The following steps were performed:
    1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by splitting it into features (X) and target (y).
    2. Histogram Plot: A histogram was plotted for all features to visualize the distribution of the data.
    3. Data Split: The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    4. Scaling: The data was scaled using StandardScaler to have zero mean and unit variance.
    5. Logistic Regression: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the scaled training data.
    6. Prediction: Predictions were made on the test set using the trained model.
    7. Classification Report: A classification report was printed to evaluate the performance of the model.
    8. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

* Result: The result of the analysis is a Logistic Regression model that can accurately detect credit card fraud transactions. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix. Successfully developed a model that detected credit card fraud transactions, providing insights to model performance and accuracy through classification matrix to evaluate model performance.
